# airline
This is a simple web application created using Django with added features with CSS, and JS. Here we will be adding some flights,including the airports and the passengers. Adding the passengers, removing them, adding flights, airports and so on. 
There are a lot of smaller things going on like data collection using the Django admin feature which is really a powerful tool to not worry about the sql queries which is auto generated.

We will be also doing some kind of testing as well to make sure the output is as I wanted using the unittest and selenium and also the yml workflow.
