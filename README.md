# airline
This is a simple web application created using Django with added features with CSS, and JS. Here we will be adding some flights,including the airports and the passengers. Adding the passengers, removing them, adding flights, airports and so on. We will be also doing some kind of testing as well to make sure the output is as I wanted.
